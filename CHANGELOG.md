## [0.0.45] (2026-08-30)

**The first LiveCoMS tutorial runs on gromos-rs**: tutorial 4 (GaMD), all four of its input files,
unmodified. Its classical force field matches gromosXX exactly at frame 0; the GaMD boost itself is
the remaining difference and now has a reference of its own.

### Added

- **`COVALENTFORM` is modelled** (NTBBH / NTBAH / NTBDN): quartic or harmonic bonds, cosine-harmonic
  or harmonic angles, arbitrary or 0°/180° dihedral phase shifts. All six forms were already
  implemented — nothing selected between them, and the block was refused, which is what blocked the
  GaMD tutorial. New reference `aladip_harmonic_covalent` (NTBBH=1, NTBAH=1) generated with
  gromosXX. Note the dihedral default is now the arbitrary-phase form, as GROMOS specifies; for
  force fields whose phase shifts are 0° or 180° (all the reference systems) the two agree exactly.
- **`INNERLOOP` passes through**: it selects which inner-loop kernel gromosXX uses (special solvent
  loops, CUDA device) and carries no physics, so it no longer stops a run.
- **`aladip_gamd` reference** — aladip + 20 SPC with a GAMD block (dual boost, production mode,
  fixed parameters) and its `@gamd` specification file; the harness and the regeneration script
  learned the flag. The test is `#[ignore]`d with the measured reason: gromosXX accumulates the
  dihedral and total forces of each acceleration group during the force calculation, scales them by
  k·(V−E) and reports ΔV = k(V−E)²/2 in the special energy (≈1.23 kJ/mol on this system); our run
  neither applies that scaling the same way nor reports the boost. The reference is the
  specification for that work (PLAN.md 1.9).

## [0.0.44] (2026-08-30)

Continuing down the LiveCoMS list, with a reference for each gap.

### Fixed

- **A trajectory frame now belongs with the energies of the same frame.** gromosXX writes both at
  the same point of a step, so its `.trc` frame 0 is the input configuration; ours wrote the state
  *after* the step, leaving structure and energy one step out of step with each other. Every
  trajectory frame of every reference system is now bit-identical to gromosXX's.
- **Truncated-octahedron output is written in the input's frame.** The engine works in the rotated
  triclinic frame `truncoct_triclinic_box` produces; gromosXX rotates positions and velocities back
  before writing (`out_configuration.cc`, `truncoct_triclinic_rotmat(false)`) and we only did it for
  forces. `aladip_trunc_oct` now compares coordinates too.
- **Every IMD block is read as a value stream**, not just `NONBONDED` and `CONSTRAINT`: `SYSTEM`,
  `STEP`, `BOUNDCOND`, `MULTIBATH` (the algorithm name and the chain length are values too),
  `INITIALISE`, `WRITETRAJ`, `PRINTOUT`, `COMTRANSROT`, `PAIRLIST`, `FORCE`, `POSITIONRES`,
  `DISTANCERES`, `PERTURBATION`, `ENERGYMIN`. `aladip_multibath_collapsed` now has *every* block on
  one line — gromosXX reads it and gives the same trajectory as the expanded file.
  A malformed `INITIALISE` fixture in `io_integration_tests.rs` (eleven values where GROMOS has ten)
  was corrected: the old line-based reader skipped the extra one and the test passed on a default.
- **`@trv` writes a velocity trajectory** instead of being accepted and ignored (`WRITETRAJ` NTWV).

### Added

- The reference harness compares the **trajectory** frame by frame (positions, images folded) and
  the **velocity trajectory**'s frame count, on top of the energies, forces, free energies and final
  configuration it already compared. Truncated-octahedron images are folded with the cube-frame
  rule, since configurations are written in the frame of the input file.
- `aladip_wrapped` writes a velocity trajectory (NTWV), so `@trv` is exercised by a reference.

### Known

- Which half-step a velocity frame carries is not yet gromosXX's: its frame 0 is the input
  velocities, ours is a half-step further on, and from frame 1 the residual is ~1e-4 nm/ps — the
  size of one thermostat scaling. The harness asserts the frames are written, not their values.

## [0.0.43] (2026-08-30)

The reference suite could not have caught the defects of 0.0.42: all 44 systems use one temperature
bath, one value per line, and molecules that are never wrapped. This release closes that blind spot
and fixes the two further defects the new references exposed.

### Added

- **Three reference systems for the input styles real GROMOS files come in**
  (`crates/gromos-md/tests/gromosXX_references/README-livecoms.md`), each generated with the same
  gromosXX binary as the rest of the suite: `aladip_multibath` (`NBATHS=2` + `DOFSET`, all bonds
  constrained), `aladip_multibath_collapsed` (the same run with `NONBONDED`/`CONSTRAINT` wrapped as
  real files write them — `TOLA2 = 1e-10` on the value stream), and `aladip_wrapped` (the solute
  split across the periodic boundary, 3.80 nm between two of its atoms in a 3.767 nm box, charge
  groups whole). gromosXX gives `aladip_multibath` and `aladip_wrapped` **the same energies** — the
  wrap is pure bookkeeping — which is exactly the property an interaction that skips the minimum
  image breaks.
- **The reference harness now compares the final configuration** (`expected/final.conf`, positions
  and velocities) and requires the frame counts to match. That is where a wrong step count shows —
  the per-step frames look right either way — and it is what let the NSTLIM+1 loop hide. Positions
  are compared modulo a periodic image; NTB = −1 systems skip the coordinate comparison, because
  gromos-rs writes the rotated triclinic frame and gromosXX the truncated-octahedron one.

### Fixed

- **Charge groups are put back into the box each step** (`LatticeShift`, gromosXX's
  `Lattice_Shift_Tracker`: solute groups by their centre of geometry, solvent groups by their first
  atom, immediately before the force field). Without it our coordinates drifted out of the box for
  ever, so the written configuration and the charge-group cutoff saw a different image than
  gromosXX's.
- **A constrained bond is no longer also a force term.** With `NTC ≥ 2` gromosXX moves those bonds
  out of the bond list when it creates the constraints, so they contribute no energy and no force;
  we computed them as well, which on `aladip_multibath` (NTC=3) put 19.36 kJ/mol of bond energy into
  a term gromosXX reports as exactly zero. `Topology::constrained_bonds` now carries the set and the
  quartic and harmonic bond loops skip it.

## [0.0.42] (2026-08-30)

Everything in this release came out of running the **GROMOS LiveCoMS tutorial suite**
(`.local/gromos_tutorial_livecoms`, six tutorials, 21 `.imd` inputs) against gromos-rs for the
first time — real GROMOS input files rather than the ones our reference suite generates. Every
defect below was invisible to the 44 reference systems because they share one style: one
temperature bath, one value per line, and molecules that are never wrapped across the box.

### Fixed

- **The MD loop ran NSTLIM+1 steps.** `start()` is `init` + a full `run_step`, so `for step in
  0..=n_steps` integrated one step too many. The written frames were unaffected (which is why the
  reference tests never caught it), but `@fin` — and therefore any continuation from it — was one
  step ahead of gromosXX. Our final configuration is now bit-identical to gromosXX's for the same
  NSTLIM (checked on `water_216_box`).
- **SHAKE ignored the minimum-image convention** (gromosXX: `shake.h::shake_iteration` takes both
  the current and the reference vector as `periodicity.nearest_image`). A solute whose atoms sit on
  opposite sides of the box — i.e. every equilibrated GROMOS configuration — could not converge:
  the tutorials' aladip has two "bonds" 3.3 nm long as stored.
- **The bonded terms ignored it too** (bonds, angles, dihedrals, impropers and their perturbed and
  soft-core variants): 40 vector sites now go through `nearest_image`, as every gromosXX bonded
  interaction does. On the tutorial system this moved the angle energy from 1183 kJ/mol to
  gromosXX's 16.86 — the whole potential energy now matches gromosXX **exactly** at frame 0.
- **`NONBONDED` and `CONSTRAINT` were parsed line by line**, but gromosXX reads every block as a
  value stream (`Block::get_next_parameter`), so the file may wrap the values anywhere. Real inputs
  put `NLRELE` on the same line as `APPAK RCRF EPSRF NSLFEXCL`, which landed `TOLA2 = 1e-10` in
  `NSLFEXCL`'s integer slot and rejected all 21 tutorial files; `CONSTRAINT` on one line silently
  lost NTCP and both tolerances. Both blocks now read through a `Tokens` cursor, error messages name
  the parameter, and `CONSTRAINT` accepts gromosXX's names and numbers (settle is 4, not 3) and
  refuses the algorithms we do not implement instead of mapping them onto another one.
- **Two crates produced a binary named `mdf`** (gromos-analysis's gromos++ port and gromos-md's
  mean-force utility), so they overwrote each other in `target/<profile>/` and the analysis
  reference test intermittently executed the wrong program. gromos-md's binaries are now declared
  explicitly and its utility is `mean_force`. (`atominfo` is still built by both gromos-analysis and
  gromos-tools — the gromos-tools one is a lesser duplicate of a ported program; left for a
  decision.)

### Added

- **Multi-bath temperature coupling** (`MULTIBATH` with NBATHS > 1, weak coupling): per-bath
  degrees of freedom exactly as `Multibath::calculate_degrees_of_freedom` counts them
  (temperature-group COM dof to the COM bath, the rest to the IR bath, constraints subtracted from
  the bath that owns them, NDFMIN spread in proportion), per-bath kinetic energy, and scaling per
  bath range. On the tutorials this reproduces gromosXX's own DOF (24.99 / 7653.01) and per-bath
  temperatures (184.41 K / 298.52 K). Every reference system uses one bath, and that path is
  unchanged. A DOFSET line with COMBATH ≠ IRBATH, and multi-bath Nosé-Hoover, are refused by name.

### Known, not yet fixed (found by the same run)

- gromosXX puts charge groups back into the box; we never wrap. On a system whose molecules are
  wrapped this still moves the trajectory apart (~3e-2 nm after 10 steps on the tutorial system)
  even though frame 0 matches exactly — the charge-group cutoff is the likely path.
- Our `.trc` writes the state *after* the first step as frame 0; gromosXX writes the initial
  configuration. `@trv` is accepted and then ignored.
- The tutorials' remaining blockers are unported features, refused by name: `ROTTRANS`,
  `PRECALCLAM`, `AEDS`, `REPLICA`, `DISTANCEFIELD`, `ORDERPARAMRES`, and `@qmmm`. `GAMD` is applied
  but unvalidated (gromosXX reports a 45.3 kJ/mol boost where we record none).

## [0.0.41] (2026-08-30)

### Added

- **gromos++ ports, batch 3** (reference tests against gromos++ output): `eds_update_1`,
  `eds_update_2` (EDS parameter updates; shared machinery in `gromos_analysis::eds`), `jepot`
  (J-value local-elevation potential, all three input modes), `pocket` (binding-site vectors,
  enclosed volume and area), `dfgrid` (distance-field grid; `cnf` output and real atoms only) and,
  in gromos-tools, `make_sasa_top`. Every gromos++ program of the analysis/tools suite is now
  ported except `cos_dipole`/`cos_epsilon` (need charge-on-spring special trajectories, which
  gromos-md does not produce), `dGslv_pbsolv` (a Poisson–Boltzmann solver — new physics, not an
  analysis port), `prep_bb` (interactive building-block editor) and `prep_xray_le` (X-ray
  local-elevation setup; no X-ray restraints in gromos-md).
- `gromos_io::jvalue`: JVALRESSPEC, JVALUERESEPS and restraint-trajectory (`.trs`) readers,
  shared by `jval` and `jepot`. `gromos_analysis::time::TimeSpec` (`@timespec`/`@timepts` frame
  selection) shared by `jval` and `jepot`; `VectorSpec` accepts `atom(<one atom>)` as a position.
- Knowingly reproduced gromos++ behaviours: `pocket` never gathers (gromos++ parses `@pbc` and
  does not apply it); `dfgrid` keeps gromos++'s open-set scan so that equal-length paths resolve
  identically. One deviation: `pocket @center atom(…)` is evaluated on the first frame — gromos++
  evaluates it before any frame is read, i.e. at the origin.

### Fixed

- `gromos_io::topology::write_parsed_topology` printed the harmonic angle constant CHT and the
  improper constant CQ in the internal unit (per rad²) instead of per degree² as the file format
  requires, and did not follow gromos++'s `OutTopology` layout (`# n` markers, number formats,
  block comments). `pt_top` output was affected. The writer now reproduces gromos++'s layout and
  is compared token by token with gromos++ in the `make_sasa_top` test.
- `TrajectoryReader` accepts configuration files as trajectories, as gromos++'s `InG96` does:
  frames without a `TIMESTEP` block, labelled `POSITION`/`VELOCITY`/`FORCE` blocks and unknown
  trailing blocks (`STOCHINT`, `PERTDATA`, …).

## [0.0.40] (2026-08-30)

### Added

- **gromos++ ports, batch 2** (reference tests against gromos++ output in
  `crates/gromos-analysis/tests/gromospp_references.rs`): `bilayer_dist`, `bilayer_oparam`,
  `jval` (Karplus ³J from dihedral time series; time series, rmsd and averages modes), `edyn`
  (essential dynamics), `gca` (generate conformations by setting bonds, angles, dihedrals).
  Two gromos++ behaviours are reproduced knowingly: `gca @mobile first` moves the first atom in
  the wrong direction (the formula is gromos++'s; `last`, the default, is right). One is not:
  gromos++'s `edyn` projects onto the *covariance-matrix columns* because `edyn.cc` discards the
  eigenvector matrix returned by `diagonaliseSymmetric` (its `EIVEC.out` equals `COVAR.out`);
  ours projects onto the eigenvectors and the test checks that the projection variances equal the
  eigenvalues. `EIVAL`/`EIFLUC`/`COVAR`/`COVATOM` match gromos++.
- `gromos_io::topology::solvate_to_atoms`: the analysis programs read every atom of a frame, as
  gromos++ `select("ALL")` does, so `s:OW`-style selections work on gromosXX trajectories.

## [0.0.39] (2026-08-30)

### Added

- **gromos++ programs missing from gromos-analysis / gromos-tools, batch 1** — each a port of the
  gromos++ source with a reference test against the gromos++ binary's output
  (`crates/gromos-analysis/tests/gromospp_references.rs`, `crates/gromos-tools/tests/`):
  `mdf` (minimum distances), `dg_ener` (exponential-averaging ΔG), `dfmult` (multi-state ΔF with
  gromos++'s log-exponential estimators), `matrix_overlap` (covariance-matrix overlap),
  `explode`, `duplicate`, `pt_top` (state-B topology; `PERTTOPO` output not implemented).
- **`tser` rewritten to gromos++'s semantics**: property specifiers (`d`, `a`, `t`, `tp`, `o`, `op`,
  `pr`, `pa`), `@time`, `@pbc` gathering, `@dist`/`@norm` distributions, `@skip`/`@stride`; output
  identical to gromos++ (titles, averages, `-nan` where gromos++ prints it). The old `tser` was a
  volume/density toy.
- Shared machinery the ports use instead of re-implementing it (the crate rule): `gromos_io::args`
  (gromos++ `Arguments`), `gromos_io::pbc` (`@pbc` and the `cog` gather), `gromos_io::table`
  (numeric column files), `gromos_analysis::{property, distribution, lnexp, time}`,
  `gromos_io::coordinate::format_g96`, `Stat::ee_strict`/`values`.

### Fixed

- **The trajectory reader mis-read gromosXX's GENBOX block** (NTB line, lengths, angles, Euler
  angles, origin): it took the NTB line as the lengths and desynchronised on the next frame —
  every analysis program failed on a real `.trc`. The writer now emits the same five-line block.

## [0.0.38] (2026-08-30)

### Added

- **MPI in `md`** (`cargo build --release --features use-mpi --bin md`, run under `mpirun`): the
  nonbonded pair terms are decomposed across ranks by first atom index (`Forcefield::pair_partition`,
  `RunOptions::pair_partition`); each rank builds the full pairlist itself and keeps its share, and
  one reduce + broadcast per step (`Forcefield::set_nonbonded_reducer`) gives every rank the same
  forces, energies, virial and dH/dλ, so every rank runs the whole integrator and rank 0 writes the
  files. `np=1` is bit-identical to the serial binary; `np=2/4` reproduce the serial energies to all
  printed digits (forces and positions to 1e-9, the summation order). `scripts/bench_mpi.py` times
  it; BENCHMARKING.md §6 has the table. `crates/gromos-run/tests/pair_partition.rs` checks the
  decomposition without MPI. `AlgorithmSequence::find_mut::<T>()` (via `Algorithm::as_any_mut`)
  reaches the built force field; `ForceStorage` carries `dhdl_lj`/`dhdl_crf`.

### Removed

- The dead MPI code: `md_mpi`, `md_mpi_cuda`, `repex_mpi`, `mpi_scaling` binaries and
  `gromos_integrators::{mpi, remd_mpi}` (an API that no longer existed, an undeclared feature, and
  `&[Vec3]` reinterpreted as `&[f32]`). REMD over MPI, when it comes, builds on the new seam.

### Changed

- The force field adds the non-pairlist terms (excluded-pair/self reaction field, 1-4, the
  perturbed corrections that are not pairlist-based) after the pair terms instead of in between;
  the reference suite (45/45), the check-suite port and the null-perturbation test are unchanged
  within their tolerances (the sums differ in the last bits only).

## [0.0.37] (2026-08-30)

### Fixed

- **`make_top` is now a port of gromos++'s `make_top`** (`utils/make_top.h`): begin/end groups
  replace atoms the way gromos++ does (the old code dropped atoms of the residue after an end
  group and skipped atoms between residues), exclusions come from the building blocks (not from
  connectivity), 1-4 pairs from the bond graph (`get14s`), bonded terms ordered as gromos++'s sets,
  several `@build` files, `OutTopology` block names and layout (`IMPDIHEDRALTYPE`,
  `TORSDIHEDRALTYPE` — the old `…TYPECODE` names made gromos++ reject the file), `CROSSDIHEDRAL*`
  and `LJEXCEPTIONS` blocks. For `NH3+ ALA GLY COO-` and a two-MTB methanol the result reads back
  identical to gromos++'s and gromos++'s reader accepts it.
- **`com_top`** wrote IACs 0-based (solute and solvent) and a `SOLUTEATOM` layout our own reader
  read as "no exclusions"; block names as above. Reads back identical to gromos++'s output.
- **The topology reader read `SOLUTEATOM` line-wise**: exclusions beyond the first line (gromos++
  wraps six per line — every protein) were dropped, and a layout with the counts on their own lines
  lost all exclusions silently. It now reads the block as the token stream gromosXX reads.
  `SOLUTEMOLECULES` with several entries per line (gromos++'s layout) was rejected.
- **The trajectory reader rejected multi-line `TITLE` blocks** (gromosXX's own `final configuration`
  files), which is why `copy_box` and `inbox` crashed on them.
- **`red_top`** wrote a comment list instead of a topology; **`copy_box`** dropped the solvent and
  wrote the box inside `POSITION`; **`inbox`** wrote nothing. All three rewritten to gromos++'s
  semantics (`@atoms 1:1-6`, `@dir x:2,y:2`, nearest image to the box centre) with `GENBOX` output.
- **`ion`** chose a different water than gromos++: the potential now includes every atom of every
  other molecule within the cutoff, Coulomb shifted by −1/R_c, as `utils::Energy` computes it.
- **`make_pt_top`** wrote a `PERTURBEDATOM` block no reader knows; now `PERTATOMPARAM` (+ the empty
  bonded blocks) as gromos++ writes.
- **`atominfo`** printed 0-based IACs; now gromos++'s columns.

### Added

- `gromos_io::topology::write_parsed_topology`: a complete writer in gromos++ `OutTopology` layout —
  what it writes reads back identical (used by `red_top`).
- Reference tests against gromos++ output for `make_top` (2), `com_top`, `red_top`, `make_pt_top`,
  `copy_box`, `inbox`, `ion` (`crates/gromos-tools/tests/`), fixtures with the exact gromos++
  commands in their READMEs. The tools audit table lives in `crates/gromos-tools/.claude/CONTEXT.md`.

## [0.0.36] (2026-08-30)

### Fixed

- **`sim_box` solvated differently from gromos++** (323 vs 352 waters, 2.148 vs 2.208 nm box for the
  same methanol and `@minwall 1.0`). Four deviations: the box was the per-axis extent instead of the
  longest solute atom–atom distance; the template was replicated `ceil(box/template)+1` times instead
  of `int(...)+1`, which shifts the lattice; the template was not centred on its centre of geometry;
  and solute hydrogens counted in the clash test (gromos++ ignores atoms of mass 1.008). Now the same
  algorithm, with a GENBOX block on output. `gromos-tools/tests/sim_box_reference.rs` compares box,
  count and every position with gromos++'s output (`tests/data/sim_box/`).
- `crates/gromos/tests/io_integration_tests.rs`: the MULTIBATH fixture had an invented DOFSET layout
  that gromosXX would reject; the energy-writer test still expected the pre-0.0.34 `ENERTRJ` block.

### Changed

- **Code quality (PLAN.md 2.4):** `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets` is clean (294 warnings
  before). The mechanical fixes were checked bit-for-bit on seven reference systems (all output files
  byte-identical). `too_many_arguments` is allowed for `gromos-forces` and `needless_range_loop` for
  the numeric crates, each with its reason next to the allow. No bare `unwrap()` is left in the
  non-test code of the library crates: user-input parses now return errors (`local_elevation`
  potential files, MOPAC input writing) and the infallible cases say why in an `expect`.
- 52 new unit tests: the SHAKE / SETTLE / LINCS algorithm wrappers, improper dihedrals (planar zero,
  finite-difference forces), temperature, Berendsen thermostat and barostat, COM-motion removal,
  pressure, energy totals, steepest descent, excluded-pair reaction field, CRF constants, IMD
  write→read, posres / distanceres / `.trg` round trips, and `gromos-run`'s degrees of freedom,
  constraint selection, bundle and prepare. Every `src` file of `gromos-integrators`, `gromos-forces`,
  `gromos-io` and `gromos-run` now carries at least one test.
- `EdsBlock` / `GamdBlock` / `ReplicaBlock`: the inherent `to_string` became `render` plus a `Display`
  impl (`.to_string()` keeps working).

## [0.0.35] (2026-08-30)

### Added

- **gromosXX's own regression oracle, ported** — `crates/gromos-md/tests/gromos_check_suite.rs`
  evaluates the per-term energies hard-coded in `md++/src/check/{aladip,aladip_unperturbed,
  aladip_special}.t.cc` (quartic bonds, angles, impropers, dihedrals, their perturbed and soft-core
  variants, the nonbonded term with both reaction-field variants and the atomic cutoff, distance
  restraints, and finite-difference λ-derivatives) on the suite's own inputs (`shared/check/`,
  byte-identical to gromosXX's). Every value is checked against the *current* gromosXX binary
  (gromos-rs matches to ten digits) and against the suite's table with the suite's own δ. The
  dihedral-restraint value is `#[ignore]`d until PLAN.md 1.6 lands.

### Fixed

- **NSLFEXCL was parsed and never consumed.** The reaction-field term of the excluded pairs and the
  self term were always added; gromosXX skips them when NSLFEXCL = 0 (`nonbonded.rf_excluded`,
  also the excluded-state term of perturbed atom pairs). `ForcefieldPlan::rf_excluded` now gates all
  three places. The default is 1, as in gromosXX (`parameter.h`); every reference input already
  says 1, so nothing else moves.
- The MULTIBATH reader assumed one line of `TEMP0 TAU` pairs; gromosXX reads the block as a token
  stream and its own check inputs list one bath per line. Now token-based — both layouts read.

## [0.0.34] (2026-08-30)

### Added

- **`.tre` in gromosXX's native layout** (`TIMESTEP` + `ENERGY03` + `VOLUMEPRESSURE03`; per-bath
  kinetic and per-group LJ/CRF from the engine's own accumulators, the untracked splits written as
  zeros and documented), and frames on gromosXX's schedule (steps 0 … NSTLIM−1). gromos++ `ene_ana`
  with the current `ene_ana.md++.lib` (`.local/gromosXX/md++/data/`) now reads gromos-rs energies
  and free energies and reports the same `totene`/`totkin`/`totpot`/`totlj`/`totcrf`/`dvdl` as for
  gromosXX's files of the same window — the LiveCoMS analysis scripts run unchanged on gromos-rs
  output. `gromos_io::read_energy_trajectory_native` reads the layout; the reference and pairlist
  tests use it.
- **dH/dλ from Python**: `Simulation.dhdl` (kJ/mol, the TI integrand), `Simulation.dhdl_terms`
  (`{"lj", "crf", "bonded"}`), and `dhdl` as the 13th column of `run()` / `EnergyTimeseries`.
- `md` writes the converged energies once more at EM convergence, as gromosXX does, so
  `aladip_vacuum_em` — ignored since the reference was made ("frame count off-by-one") — passes.
  **The Rust reference suite is 45 of 45.**
- `tests/fep_null_perturbation.rs`: a `.ptp` with identical end states and α = 0 must leave energies
  and forces bit-identical to the unperturbed run, and α ≠ 0 must not — the invariance that pinned
  the FEP defects, now a permanent test.

### Fixed — every FEP reference now matches gromosXX

Found by bisecting `aladip_vacuum_fep` against the native gromosXX one perturbation block, atom
and property at a time, ending with *null perturbations* (identical A and B states, α = 0) — a
non-zero Δ there is a bookkeeping bug by construction. `aladip_vacuum_fep`, ignored since 1.7,
passes; so do `meoh_water_fep` and CH4 at five λ. Rust suite 44 passed / 1 ignored (`aladip_vacuum_em`,
an EM frame-count question, not physics); Python suite 344 passed, no xfail left.

- **Perturbed nonbonded electrostatics, two defects found by bisecting `aladip_vacuum_fep` against
  gromosXX with single-block `.ptp` files.** (1) The soft-core pair kernel's reaction-field term
  used `crf/(2·R_c³)` where gromosXX uses `crf/2` before dividing by the softened cutoff³ — an
  extra 1/R_c³ on the r² term of every perturbed pair, invisible with zero charges (CH4) and
  0.16 kJ/mol on methanol. (2) The pairlist correction only soft-cored pairs whose *lower-index*
  atom was perturbed; gromosXX routes a pair to the perturbed list when either atom is. A
  perturbed atom that is not at the start of the topology lost most of its soft-core pairs.
  `meoh_water_fep` now passes (energies, positions, forces, dH/dλ per term, ten steps);
  every single-atom null/charge/type variant of the dipeptide is exact.
- **λ-mixed masses were never applied** in the `md` path (`mass_at_lambda` had no caller):
  `prepare_system` now sets m(λ) = (1−λ)·m_A + λ·m_B for perturbed atoms, as gromosXX's
  `update_for_lambda` does.
- **`PERTATOMPAIR` entries were ignored unless some atom was also perturbed** (the whole perturbed
  nonbonded block was guarded by "any perturbed atom"), their CRF part was never applied, and an
  "excluded" end state dropped the reaction-field term an excluded pair keeps in gromosXX.
- With these, **`aladip_vacuum_fep` passes** — the reference that had been `ignore`d since 1.7 —
  and every FEP reference (CH4 at five λ, methanol, the dipeptide) matches gromosXX. Suite: 44
  passed, 1 ignored (`aladip_vacuum_em`, an EM frame-count question, not physics).

- Perturbed bonded energies (bonds, angles, impropers, dihedrals, and their soft variants) are
  booked in their own `.tre` columns instead of all in `bond_total` — totals were right, columns
  were not (`ForceEnergyLambda` carries the split). In the `aladip_vacuum_fep` bisection the
  angle-, improper- and dihedral-only cases are now exact against gromosXX.
- A perturbation topology whose only content is soft-core bonded terms (`PERTBONDSOFT`,
  `PERTANGLESOFT`, `PERTIMPROPERDIHSOFT`) or perturbed atom pairs counted as *empty*
  (`PerturbedSolute::is_empty` ignored those lists): the regular term was removed from the topology
  and nothing replaced it. Every soft bonded case of the `aladip_vacuum_fep` bisection is now exact
  against gromosXX (the soft-core formulas themselves were already right).

## [0.0.33] (2026-08-29)

### Fixed

- **dH/dλ was never compared against gromosXX.** The reference suite (and `gromos-io`'s `.trg`
  reader, hence `ext_ti_ana`) looked for a one-line `FREEENERGY03` block, while the native binary
  writes `TIMESTEP` + `FREEENERDERIVS03` (`# lambda`, `# totals` in ENERGY03 order, per-bath and
  per-group sections) — so every "dH/dλ tracked" claim since 1.7 rested on zero frames. The reader
  now parses both layouts, the reference test compares the total and the LJ / CRF / bonded parts
  per frame (aligned by time), and the writer emits the native layout with the run's bath and
  energy-group counts (per-group derivatives as zeros).
- The perturbed nonbonded derivative is split into its LJ and CRF parts
  (`PertNBCorrection::dhdl_lj/dhdl_crf`, `Energy::dhdl_lj/dhdl_crf/dhdl_bonded`), so the `.trg`
  carries the same per-term derivatives gromosXX writes.

### Added

- **CH4 λ-range references** `ch4_water_fep_l000/l025/l075/l100` (ten steps each, NTWG=1): the
  proven CH4 → dummy system at λ = 0, 0.25, 0.75, 1 — energies, positions, forces and now dH/dλ
  (total, LJ, CRF, bonded) match gromosXX at every λ. Reference suite: 42 pass, 3 ignored.
- `scripts/ti_ch4.py`: thermodynamic integration of CH4 → dummy through gromosXX and gromos-rs
  from the same inputs (11 windows, NVT 300 K), integrated with the project's `ext_ti_ana`;
  per-window ⟨∂H/∂λ⟩ ± ee (n) for both engines, ΔG and timings, into `bench/work/ti_ch4/`.
- `scripts/regen_gromosXX_references.py <system …>` regenerates only the named systems.

## [0.0.32] (2026-08-29)

### Added (PLAN.md 3.9 step 5 — the first new term through the new door)

- **`meoh_water_fep` reference system** (gromosXX native build, ten steps at λ = 0.5): 54a7 united-atom
  methanol (charged) → dummies in 953 SPC waters, built with gromos++ `make_top` and the project's
  `sim_box`, minimised and equilibrated with gromosXX. It exercises the perturbed reaction-field
  self/excluded-pair terms that the zero-charge `ch4_water_fep` never could — and fails today (CRF off
  by 0.16 kJ/mol at frame 0, LJ exact): registered as `ignore` in the Rust suite and a strict xfail in
  the Python suite until the term is second-sourced (PLAN.md 1.7). The `aladip_vacuum_fep` mismatch was
  bisected block by block against gromosXX; findings in PLAN.md 1.7.

- **`Term("xtb", region=..., elements=[...], gfn=2, charge=0, multiplicity=1, work_dir=None,
  timeout_s=600, coupling="delta")`** — a real GFN-xTB subprocess (`XtbInteraction`) over a region,
  additive on top of the classical force field, no cargo feature. Wiring: the `TermSpec::Xtb`
  variant (`recipe.rs`), its registry lines (`plan.rs`) and one `instantiate` arm (`build.rs`);
  `gromos.terms()` lists it, `_TermKind` in the stubs names it. Each xtb term gets its own
  `work_dir` (`<tmp>/gromos-rs-xtb-term-<index>` unless given) and every xtb call is bounded by
  `timeout_s` (`XtbInteraction::with_timeout`, `qm_subprocess::run_subprocess_with_timeout`: the
  child is killed and the step fails with a clear error instead of hanging).
- **Per-term energies (G10, in memory).** `Energy.term_energies: Vec<(String, f64)>` is filled by
  the orchestrator every step (`ProviderOrchestrator::register_labelled` / `evaluate_with_terms`),
  keyed by the term's registry name (`xtb`, or `xtb:0`/`xtb:1` for a repeated kind), in plan
  order; `Simulation.term_energies -> dict[str, float]`. Their sum is what the terms add to
  `total_energy`; `potential_energy` stays the classical force field alone. Not yet in the `.tre`
  file or in `run()`'s columns.
- Documentation pass for the recipe model: root `README.md` (components, "How a run is described"),
  `py-gromos/README.md` (rewritten), a new concept page `py-gromos/docs/user-guide/recipe.md`
  (in the mkdocs nav), the API reference without the deleted building blocks, `gromos-run`'s crate
  doc, the `md`/`pyo3-gromos`/`parameters` module docs, `.claude/overview.md`/`architecture.md`,
  `FUTURE.md`'s 2026-07 addendum marked resolved, `BENCHMARKING.md`'s parity note, and the design
  mockup notebook marked superseded.
- `py-gromos/tests/test_xtb_term.py` — the physics oracle from the Python side: adding the term
  adds exactly `XtbPotential`'s direct energy and forces of the region (and nothing outside it),
  two terms report separately and add up, NVE through the real step loop holds the Rust oracle's
  thresholds, `coupling="replace"` / a barostat / an `elements` table that does not cover the
  region / a `timeout_s` that expires are each a named error. Skips without `xtb` on PATH.

## [0.0.31] (2026-08-29)

### Removed (PLAN.md 3.9 step 4 — delete the copies)

- The Python **descriptor path**: `resolve_algorithm_sequence` (the second IMD→sequence builder),
  `AlgorithmDescriptor`, and the twelve building-block classes (`Forcefield`, `LeapFrogIntegrator`,
  `LeapFrogVelocity`, `LeapFrogPosition`, `BerendsenThermostat`, `BerendsenBarostat`,
  `ShakeConstraints`, `SteepestDescent`, `TemperatureCalculation`, `PressureCalculation`,
  `EnergyCalculation`, `RemoveCOMMotion`). The MD step is `gromos.Plan` from `recipe.plan(system)`;
  `crates/pyo3-gromos/src/algorithm_sequence.rs` went from 1473 to ~100 lines and builds nothing.
- `gromos.md_runners` (subprocess wrappers around the `md` binary) — `Simulation` is the way to run
  MD from Python. `gromos.analysis` is no longer in the default namespace (`import gromos.analysis`
  still works). The placeholder suites `test_basic.py` / `test_advanced_features.py` (eleven skipped
  classes for a past API) — `test_recipe.py` covers the surface they described.
- `py-gromos`'s `glam` dependency.

### Changed

- `AlgorithmSequence.nve/nvt/npt/minimize/from_parameters(topo, params)` (deprecated) now return the
  `Plan` of `params` — the ensemble comes from the parameters, not from the preset name — and
  `Simulation.from_sequence(topo, conf, params, plan)` takes that `Plan`; `AlgorithmSequence` itself
  cannot be instantiated. `Simulation.recipe` / `.plan` / `.recipe_toml` / `.plan_json` are always
  present (no `None` case left).
- `Vec3`, `Frame`, `rmsd`, `rdf` are f64 (`gromos_core::math::Vec3`), not f32.
- Atom-count and factory-argument errors are `gromos.exceptions.RecipeError` (still a `ValueError`).
- One IMD reader: `gromos_run::read_imd` — the `md` binary, `Recipe.from_imd`, the deprecated
  `InputParameters` and the bundle loader all open parameter files through it.
- `just lint` runs the G6 drift gates after clippy: `AlgorithmSequence::new()` outside `gromos-run`,
  `.push(Box::new(` in the binding, `read_imd_file(`/`parse_imd_str(` outside `gromos-run`/
  `gromos-io`, `process::exit` in `gromos-run` — each grep must print nothing.
- `test_front_end_parity.py`: path C and its `xfail` table are gone; the deprecated
  `AlgorithmSequence`/`from_sequence` names are checked as a translation (`array_equal` against the
  `Recipe` path) instead.

## [0.0.30] (2026-08-29)

### Added

- **`gromos.Recipe`, `Term`, `Algorithm`, `Plan` — the run as data, in Python (PLAN.md 3.9
  step 3).** They *are* the `gromos-run` types (serde ↔ Python through `pythonize`; no Python-side
  copy to drift). `Recipe.from_imd/from_toml/from_json/from_dict/from_bundle`, `Recipe.nve/nvt/npt/
  minimize`, one getter per group (`.control`, `.ensemble`, `.constraints`, …), immutable
  `update(**groups)` (deep merge), `with_term/without_terms/with_inputs/with_execution`,
  `to_imd/save_imd/to_bundle`, `==`, pickling. `recipe.plan(system)` is the validated MD step as an
  editable `Plan` (addressed by index or kind; `insert/insert_after/insert_before/remove/replace/
  validate`; JSON) and `Simulation(system, recipe, plan=plan)` runs it — stage 1 of the same builder,
  not a second one. `Simulation.recipe`/`.plan` objects, `Simulation.from_bundle`. Registries:
  `gromos.terms()`, `gromos.algorithms()` (with the ordering rules), `gromos.build_info()`.
- `gromos.exceptions`: `RecipeError`, `PlanError` (⊂ `ValueError`), `MissingFeatureError`,
  `RunError` (⊂ `RuntimeError`). A typo'd field or an unknown kind is a `RecipeError`, never a
  silent default. `Term("schnet", …)` constructs on a non-`ml` build with `available=False`;
  `Simulation` then raises `MissingFeatureError` (A14).
- Drift guards (G2/G5/G6): `test_front_end_parity.py` compares the `Recipe` front-end and the `Plan`
  front-end against the deprecated `InputParameters` path with `np.array_equal` on every reference
  system (no divergences); `test_every_kind_has_a_parity_case` / `test_pyi_lists_every_kind` fail
  when an algorithm kind is added without a reference case or a stub; `mypy.stubtest` is clean
  against `gromos.pyi` (`MYPYPATH=python python -m mypy.stubtest gromos.gromos --allowlist
  stubtest_allowlist_no_ml.txt`; without the allowlist on an `ml` build).

### Changed

- `test_gromosXX_references.py` builds every reference run as `Simulation(system,
  Recipe.from_imd(...).with_inputs(...))`: the recipe front-end is the gromosXX-guarded one.
- `System(topology, configuration)` / `System.from_files` accept a solute topology with a solvated
  coordinate file (solute plus whole solvent molecules); `prepare_system` solvates from the
  coordinate count, as the `md` binary does.
- `Recipe.__repr__` says NVE when no bath couples (TAU < 0 is gromosXX's "no coupling"; the bath is
  kept so the `.imd` round-trips).
- `gromos.__version__` comes from the installed distribution metadata; notebooks `01`/`02` and the
  Python docs use `Recipe`.

### Deprecated (one release; each emits a `DeprecationWarning` naming its replacement)

- `InputParameters(path)` / `.from_file` / `.nve` / `.nvt` / `.npt` / `.steepest_descent` →
  `Recipe.from_imd` / `Recipe.nve|nvt|npt|minimize`; `Simulation(system, InputParameters)` →
  `Simulation(system, recipe)`.
- `Simulation(..., distrest=, posresspec=, refpos=)` → `recipe.with_inputs(...)`;
  `Simulation(..., ml_potential=, ml_region=, ml_buffer=)` → `recipe.with_term(Term("schnet", ...))`.
- `AlgorithmSequence.nve|nvt|npt|minimize|from_parameters` and `Simulation.from_sequence` →
  `recipe.plan(system)` + `Simulation(system, recipe, plan=plan)`.

## [0.0.29] (2026-08-29)

### Added

- **`RunRecipe` — the run as plain data (PLAN.md 3.9 step 2).** `gromos-run` now builds every
  run from a versioned, serde-serialisable recipe: `.imd` → `RunRecipe::from_imd` →
  `build_plan` → `Vec<AlgorithmSpec>` (fully resolved) → `validate_plan` → `instantiate` (reads
  only the plan) → `start`. The `md` binary and `Simulation` both go through it; a frozen copy of
  the step-1 builder is the test oracle and the recipe path is bit-identical to it on all 41
  reference systems. `md @dump` prints recipe + plan as JSON; `md` writes `<tre>.recipe.toml`
  with the parser diagnostics; `Simulation.recipe_toml` / `.plan_json` / `.diagnostics`.
- `.imd` **writer** (`gromos_io::imd_write::write_imd`) and a lossless, strict parser: every
  field of every modelled block round-trips exactly (multi-line TITLE, NTIRTC/NTISTI, NTWSE/NTWG/
  NTWB, NTPP, NCYC, NTCS0, DOF sets, PRESSURESCALE COUPLE/SEMI, NONBONDED lattice-sum lines;
  NTWV/NTWF are frequencies, not booleans), and a malformed number is an error naming the block
  and token instead of a silent 0. `parse_imd_str` for in-memory text.
- `scripts/roundtrip_imd_gromosXX.py`: feeds every rewritten `.imd` to the real gromosXX —
  **40/40** accepted and reproducing a fresh run of the original exactly. It caught two writer
  defects a Rust round trip could not (fused columns; an invented "off" DISTANCERES block that
  gromosXX validates).
- `validate_plan`: GROMOS ordering invariants as per-kind rules (one `forcefield`, `orchestrator`
  right after it, `energy_calculation` last, steepest descent excludes the dynamics kinds,
  barostat requires the pressure calculation, a term without a virial cannot meet a barostat,
  `coupling=replace` rejected until the zone-aware Forcefield exists).

### Fixed

- **An `.imd` without a MULTIBATH block no longer runs a Berendsen bath**: the parameter defaults
  now mean "block absent" (no bath; `nscm = 0` for a missing COMTRANSROT, as gromosXX's
  `parameter.h`), so `water_216_nve_nobath` passes in both suites and is no longer ignored.
- More than one temperature bath is a named error (`build_plan`) instead of a silent truncation
  to the first bath.

## [0.0.28] (2026-08-29)

### Added

- **`gromos-run` crate — the one run builder (PLAN.md 3.9 step 1).** The IMD → algorithm-
  sequence assembly that the `md` binary and the Python binding each carried (and had let
  drift) now lives once, as a library: `prepare_system` (perturbation topology, truncated-
  octahedron transform, NSM from the coordinate file, validation, initial velocities),
  `build_sequence_from_imd` (the GROMOS step order), `start` (init + step 0), `total_dof`, and a
  `RunError` in place of the binary's `println!`/`process::exit` sites. `md.rs` shrank from 2060
  to 1359 lines; `pyo3-gromos`'s `build_simulation` contains no algorithm construction at all.
- Divergences resolved toward the binary: Python now honours the topology's PHYSICALCONSTANTS
  (`four_pi_eps_i`), takes NSM from the coordinate file, uses the same parallel-kernel policy
  (`ParallelPolicy::Auto` = parallel above 100 atoms), and one DOF formula that also counts
  solute constraints (the binary's old `TODO`; no reference combines NTC>1 with a live
  thermostat, so no reference result moved).
- FEP from Python: `Topology.apply_perturbation(path)` (the `.ptp` merge is now a
  `Topology` method in gromos-core, shared with `md @pttopo`); `ch4_water_fep` joins the Python
  reference suite and passes; `aladip_vacuum_fep` is a strict xfail like the Rust `ignore`.
- `AlgorithmSequence::insert` (gromos-core) so the ML term can be placed after `Forcefield`
  without a second builder.
- `crates/gromos-run/tests/prepare_and_build.rs`: NSM-from-coordinates, solute-constraint DOF,
  perturbation/NTG consistency, named errors.

### Changed

- The descriptor path (`AlgorithmSequence.from_parameters` → `resolve_algorithm_sequence`) uses
  the same parallel policy and physical constants as the shared builder, so the front-end parity
  test stays exact on >100-atom systems; its other gaps (SETTLE, LINCS, Nosé-Hoover, NTICOM=2,
  truncated octahedron, restraints, FEP) remain strict xfails until the recipe plan replaces it
  (PLAN.md 3.9 steps 2–4).
- Suites after the lift: Rust reference 37 passed / 3 ignored; Python 208 passed, 16 skipped,
  18 xfailed.

## [0.0.27] (2026-08-29)

### Added

- **PLAN.md 3.9 step 0 — front-end parity measured before any refactor.**
  `py-gromos/tests/test_front_end_parity.py`: every reference system through `Simulation(...)` and
  through `AlgorithmSequence.from_parameters(...)`, compared with `np.array_equal` (never a
  tolerance) on per-step energies, final positions and forces, plus a `same_path_twice` determinism
  baseline. Result: 27/37 systems bit-identical between the two builders; the 10 divergences
  (SETTLE, LINCS ×2, Nosé-Hoover ×2, NTICOM=2 rotation removal, truncated-octahedron box,
  restraints ×3) are `xfail(strict=True)` entries naming the missing feature, mirrored in PLAN.md
  3.9's divergence table.
- New gromosXX reference `water_216_nve_nobath` (generated with the CODATA-patched
  `.local/gromosXX/md++/BUILD/program/md`, the only build that reproduces the committed references
  bit-for-bit): `water_216_box` with the MULTIBATH block absent. gromosXX runs no temperature
  coupling; gromos-rs's IMD parser keeps `TempBathParameters::default()` and silently thermostats.
  Registered as an ignored test (Rust) / strict xfail (Python) until PLAN.md 3.9 step 2 makes the
  parser presence-aware.
- `scripts/kernel_determinism.py` — run-to-run and thread-count determinism of the `md` binary
  (n = 3): bit-identical run-to-run at a fixed thread count; 1 vs 8 threads differ at ~1e-13
  relative. Recorded in BENCHMARKING.md ("Kernel determinism").

### Changed

- `test_steepest_descent_via_algorithm_sequence` compares energies and positions between the two
  builders, not only algorithm names.
- PLAN.md: finished items condensed to their load-bearing decisions (full notes moved verbatim to
  the new `PLAN_ARCHIVE.md`); 3.8 audit extended with verified engine divergences; 3.9 rewritten as
  a checkable plan (assumptions A1–A19, drift guards G1–G10, steps 0–5 with gates) after a
  five-perspective review — OpenMM, GROMACS, HOOMD-blue, ASE/i-PI/PLUMED, Polars/pyo3 — archived in
  `PLAN_ARCHIVE.md` §3.9-review.

### Known engine defects recorded (not yet fixed)

- An `.imd` without a MULTIBATH block runs a Berendsen bath at 300 K, τ = 0.1, in both the `md`
  binary and Python; every builder also reads only `temp_bath[0]`, so multi-bath inputs are
  truncated. Fix scheduled in PLAN.md 3.9 step 2 (A18).

## [0.0.26] (2026-08-29)

### Performance

Single-core benchmarking against gromosXX 1.6.0 (both `-march=native`) began with gromos-rs at
0.48× (`water_216_box`), 0.77× (`water_1000_spc_gridcell`) and 0.82× (`ch4_water_fep`) of
gromosXX's speed. After this work it is at 0.97×, 1.11× and 0.90× (mean ratios, n = 3–5), and
**1.14× on a 24 000-atom production-regime box** (NSNB=5, twin-range, grid_cell) built with
`sim_box` via `scripts/make_solvated_box.py`. With 8 threads (Phase 3) it is 1.38× faster than
gromosXX's OpenMP build on that box and 1.06× on the 3 000-atom system; before the
parallel-pairlist work it was 0.53× and 0.43× there. See `BENCHMARKING.md`. Every change preserves the reference-suite
output; the nonbonded kernels are bit-identical per pair to the previous scalar code.

- **gromos-core:** `Rectangular::nearest_image` rounds ties-to-even (`rint`, as gromosXX does)
  instead of ties-away-from-zero — the latter has no native x86 encoding and was ~47 % of the
  nonbonded kernel on `water_216_box`.
- **gromos-core:** cell-list pairlist takes its grid spacing from the IMD `PAIRLIST` `SIZE` field
  (`auto` = half the short cutoff, as gromosXX) instead of a hardcoded cutoff-wide cell, and prunes
  cell pairs by true inter-cell distance instead of a cubic shell. On `water_1000` the old sizing
  produced a 3×3×3 grid where every cell neighboured every other, i.e. no pruning at all.
  Pairlist phase 3.15 s → 2.15 s. `SIZE` had been parsed and never used.
- **gromos-core:** `PairlistContainer` stores `(u32, u32)`; the per-step copy into `u32` in the
  forcefield is gone (2.5 s on `ch4_water_fep`) and pairlist write traffic is halved.
- **gromos-core:** `is_excluded_or_14` / `is_excluded` query one side of the (symmetric, sorted)
  lists with gromosXX's `last < j` early-out; 1-4 pairs are now stored symmetrically by the reader.
  Invariants pinned by `gromos-io/tests/exclusion_invariants.rs`.
- **gromos-forces:** LJ/CRF innerloop evaluates four pairs per `f64x4` register (divide and sqrt
  were the arithmetic cost); the flat, charge-group-grouped and solvent kernels now share one
  `process_pair_slice` — the file's "single source of truth" promise now holds.
- **gromos-forces:** parallel kernels size chunks per thread instead of per 1024 pairs, which was
  allocating and merging a full force buffer 61 times per step on `water_216_box`; also fixes a
  latent `par_chunks(0)` panic when there are fewer charge-group pairs than threads.
- **gromos-core / gromos-integrators:** long-range solvent–solvent pairs are stored as one sentinel
  pair per molecule pair and evaluated with a shared periodic shift when that is provably exact
  for the box (`sentinel_long_range_is_exact`; `PairlistContainer::solvent_long_is_sentinel`),
  as the short-range solvent list always was; otherwise the expanded per-atom-image path is kept.
  Verified against the expanded path by `gromos-forces/tests/solvent_longrange_sentinel.rs`.
- **gromos-integrators:** long-range kernels use the `_novirial` variants when no pressure
  coupling reads the virial, matching the short-range path.
- **gromos-core:** pairlist construction runs in parallel — the cell list over cell ranges, the
  standard O(N²) algorithm over charge-group ranges — into private lists appended in order, so
  pair order and all outputs are unchanged. Per-pair debug logging in the standard algorithm's
  hot loop was removed.
- **gromos-integrators:** charge-group pair-group metadata is built in parallel (per-chunk runs
  stitched at chunk boundaries; identical group boundaries).
- **gromos-integrators:** the long-range block dispatches to the parallel kernels when
  `parallel_nonbonded` is set, as the short-range block already did; both phases previously ran
  serial regardless of thread count.
- **bench:** `scripts/bench_engines.py` reports n, mean, standard deviation, median and min;
  `scripts/make_solvated_box.py` builds large solvated boxes through the project's `sim_box`.
- **gromos-integrators:** twin-range long-range solute interactions use the charge-group-grouped
  kernel (one `nearest_image` per CG pair) under the same safety condition as short-range, and
  reuse one force buffer; 1.59 s → 0.60 s on `water_1000`.
- **gromos-integrators / gromos-core:** per-algorithm and per-force-phase timing is opt-in
  (`AlgorithmSequence::enable_timing`); `md @verb 1` prints a `TIMING` block comparable line by
  line with gromosXX's. Previously two `Instant::now()` calls per algorithm per step ran
  unconditionally.

### Fixed

- **gromos-md:** `md` panicked with "remainder with a divisor of zero" whenever `NTWX`, `NTWE` or
  `NTPR` was 0 (GROMOS: "never write").
- **gromos-core:** `PAIRLIST` `TYPE atomic` was parsed and ignored; it now selects the atom-based
  cutoff. `ALGORITHM grid` fell through to the O(N²) algorithm; it now selects the cell list
  (documented deviation: same pair set, different traversal).
- **gromos-core:** `Topology::solvate` left `one_four_pairs` at the solute length; any per-atom
  query on a solvent atom (reachable via `TYPE atomic`) indexed past the end.
- **gromos-md:** `benches/md_bench.rs`, `scripts/benchmark.sh` and
  `scripts/regen_gromosXX_references.py` pointed at non-existent paths.

### Added

- `BENCHMARKING.md`: the engine-vs-engine protocol, assumptions, and measured results;
  `scripts/bench_engines.py`: the harness that produces them.

## [0.0.25] (2026-08-13)

### Features

- **gromos-core:** `SpatialIndex` trait (`spatial_index.rs`) — query-based neighbor service ("pairs within r of this selection"), independent of the MD pairlist's charge-group/twin-range/solvent-sentinel shape so it can serve arbitrary-cutoff consumers (ML radial graphs, QM-zone gathers) later. `ConfigurationSpatialIndex` is the first (brute-force, atom-level, exclusion-free) implementation; carries periodic-image shift vectors per pair so a later periodic ML/QM provider doesn't force a breaking signature change (FUTURE.md Dim 12.5 point 3 / P3)
- **gromos-forces:** `PotentialProvider` trait (`provider.rs`) — the additive-provider shape for force/energy computation (`architecture.md` "provider pattern"; FUTURE.md Dim 12.5), so classical terms, and eventually QM/MM/ML potentials, are all the same kind of thing. `contribute()` takes read-only `Topology`/`Configuration` plus an arbitrary `AtomSelection` region and a `SpatialIndex`, returns a scattered `Contribution` (energy + sparse per-atom forces + virial + extensible `ProviderExtra`) rather than raw `&mut Configuration` access — reviewed and corrected before landing (see Testing) so a provider can't touch atoms outside what it's scoped to
- **gromos-forces:** `LjCrfInteraction` (`nonbonded/interaction.rs`) — the first `PotentialProvider` impl, wrapping the existing `lj_crf_innerloop_novirial` with zero math changes to prove the shape is transparent. Named `*Interaction` (not `*Provider`) to match gromosXX's own `Nonbonded_Interaction`/`QMMM_Interaction` base-class convention. Scoped to solute-solute atom-level pairs only this pass — solvent's charge-group "sentinel pair per molecule pair" pairlist shape doesn't fit the generic `SpatialIndex` query and needs its own adapter, deferred to the wiring pass
- **gromos-forces:** `SchNetInteraction` (`nonbonded/schnet.rs`, feature-gated `ml`, default builds untouched) — the first ML `PotentialProvider`: loads a TorchScript model via `tch`/libtorch and runs it **in-process**, no Python subprocess or embedded interpreter, closing the loop on the whole reason this groundwork exists. Now loads a real `schnetpack.model.NeuralNetworkPotential` (SchNetPack **2.x**, not a hand-rolled reimplementation — see Notes), calling it via its actual `Dict[str, Tensor]` I/O contract; forces are computed by the model's own internal `Forces` module, no manual `.backward()` needed. Consumes the same `SpatialIndex` classical terms use for its radial graph — `SchNetPack`'s own `PairwiseDistances` expects a host-supplied neighbor list too, confirming FUTURE.md P3 (one spatial service, multiple consumers) against a real, current ML library, not just GROMACS's NNPot interface
- **scripts:** `export_toy_schnet.py` — now builds a real (still randomly initialized/untrained) SchNetPack 2 `SchNet` + `Forces` model and exports it via TorchScript, replacing the earlier hand-rolled single cfconv block

### Testing

- **gromos-core:** `spatial_index::tests` — vacuum and periodic (minimum-image + shift-vector) neighbor queries
- **gromos-forces:** `nonbonded::interaction::tests::wrapper_transparency_matches_direct_call` — `LjCrfInteraction` vs. a direct `lj_crf_innerloop_novirial` call, bit-identical (transparency check, not independent oracle coverage on its own)
- **gromos-forces:** `nonbonded::interaction::tests::cross_checks_against_single_point_energy_oracle` — cross-checked against `single_point_energy`'s already reference-suite-validated LJ+CRF total on a 4-atom fixture (no exclusions/1-4, so the only reconciliation needed is gromosXX's unconditional per-atom RF self-energy term, which this pairlist-only provider deliberately excludes) — a genuine second computation path, since `single_point_energy` builds its pairlist via the existing chargegroup-aware `StandardPairlistAlgorithm`, independent of the new `ConfigurationSpatialIndex`
- **gromos-forces:** `nonbonded::schnet::tests::model_forces_match_finite_differences` (feature `ml`) — there is no GROMOS oracle for a neural-network potential (FUTURE.md P8), so this is the tolerance-based second test tier the plan called for: central finite differences on the energy surface vs. the model's own forces, agreeing to `<5e-3` absolute (widened from `1e-3`; the real SchNetPack interaction block has more float32-accumulating layers than the old hand-rolled one — verified per-component that the ~1.4e-3 gap is noise, not a bug, before loosening)
- **gromos-md:** `tests/test_provider_reference.rs::lj_crf_interaction_matches_real_gromosxx_energy` — a real gromosXX-reference test, not another internal cross-check: loads the `pair_lj` reference system directly via `gromos-io` readers, runs `LjCrfInteraction` in-process, and matches the actual gromosXX-produced `expected/energies.tre` to the standard `1e-8` relative tolerance. `pair_lj` was picked because it fits this provider's current scope exactly (solute-only, zero charge, no exclusions)
- **gromos-forces:** `tests/schnet_burnn_reference.rs::schnet_provider_on_real_burnn_methanol_qm_zone` (feature `ml`) — runs `SchNetInteraction` on the real BuRNN tutorial's actual equilibrated, solvated methanol configuration (`eq/eq_meoh_5.cnf`), using the real `QMZONE` atom selection/atomic numbers and `RCUTQM` cutoff read directly off the tutorial's own `.qmm`/`.imd` files, not a synthetic fixture. **Caught a real bug**: `SchNetInteraction` assumed every neighbor pair had both endpoints inside the region, which panicked the instant a real region-inside-a-solvated-system geometry was used (`SpatialIndex::neighbor_pairs` deliberately also returns pairs reaching outside the selection, for FUTURE.md P5's future embedding case). Fixed by skipping out-of-region pairs, documented as a current limitation (no electrostatic embedding support yet) rather than silently worked around
- `cargo test -p gromos-md --test test_gromosXX_references` reconfirmed 37/37 unchanged after both the classical and the `ml`-feature work — none of it touches any existing call site

### Features (P2.7 — electrostatic embedding onto MM atoms)

- **gromos-forces:** `Embedding {None, Mechanical, Electrostatic}` + a defaulted `PotentialProvider::embedding()` — how a provider treats atoms *outside* its region is now a declared property rather than an accident. `SchNetInteraction` declares `None` (its `Dict[str,Tensor]` contract has no environment channel) and **rejects** an unsupported scheme with a clear error instead of silently ignoring it — the P2.6 cross-boundary bug was exactly an unstated assumption here
- **gromos-forces:** `ElectrostaticEmbedding` (`nonbonded/embedding.rs`) — the QM↔MM Coulomb coupling term, and the **first provider to put forces on atoms outside its own region** (FUTURE.md P5). Implements Poliak et al. 2025's path (c) (QM charges + pairwise Coulomb computed in the MD code; their paths (a)/(b) are adapters over a QM engine's output, not new physics). Validated against a **closed-form two-point-charge oracle** (exact analytic energy *and* force), plus finite differences on an MM atom in both a toy and the real solvated `t_06` system
- **gromos-forces:** `zones.rs` — `Zone {Inner, Buffer, Outer}` / `PairOwner {Provider, Classical, Embedding}` / `ZonePartition::owner()`: the six-pair-class ownership table that prevents double-counting, derived term-by-term from the BuRNN training target rather than assumed. Deliberately an *orchestration* type, not logic hidden inside a provider; degrades to plain QM/MM without a buffer and to fully-classical without zones

### Testing (P2.7)

- **gromos-forces:** `tests/embedding_gather_reference.rs` — confirms assumption A1 on the real `t_06` system (**1363 MM embedding partners** within 1.4 nm of the QM zone; charges, positions and force-output all reachable through today's trait, so **no signature change was needed**), and finite-difference-validates embedding forces on a real MM atom at scale
- **gromos-forces:** `tests/zone_partition_reference.rs` — the ownership table **partitions** the real system's interactions with no gaps (vanished physics) and no overlaps (double-counting): 3513 atoms → inner 6 / buffer 99 / outer 3408, 6659 QM-cutoff pairs cleanly owned
- **gromos-forces:** `zones::tests` (6) and `nonbonded::embedding::tests` (3) — ownership symmetry, exact exclusion set, degradation to plain QM/MM; analytic Coulomb, MM-atom finite differences, and intra-region pairs proven not double-counted

### Features + Testing (P2.8-2a — NN/MM wired into a real step loop)

- **gromos-md:** `ml` feature (forwards to `gromos-forces/ml`) + `tests/schnet_nve_loop.rs` — `SchNetInteraction` driving actual leapfrog dynamics via `gromos-integrators::LeapFrog`, not another single-point evaluation. 500-step NVE trajectory on a small vacuum molecule: kinetic energy goes from a standing start (0) to 0.081 kJ/mol, total energy stays within 0.0047% of its mean. Chose NVE conservation because it's architecture-blind to whether the (still untrained) potential is chemically meaningful while genuinely testing the loop — force eval → integrate → force eval again — the same way the classical suite validates bulk NVE systems like `water_216_box`, just against a self-consistency bound instead of a gromosXX oracle (none exists for an untrained NN, FUTURE.md P8)
- `dt=1e-3` was picked by scanning `1e-4..2e-3` and taking the largest step still producing real dynamics with tight conservation — not guessed; tolerances set at ~100x the measured margin

### Notes

- **Two claims made earlier in this work were wrong and are corrected here**, both caught by reading the tutorial's own source rather than trusting a summary: (1) the BuRNN training target is **QM−QM**, not QM−MM — `get_burnn_energy()` subtracts two MOPAC energies, with the vacuum terms as per-species normalisation; (2) the shipped BuRNN model **predicts no charges** — a single `Atomwise` output, `property=energy`, `derivative=forces` — so the charge-output channel initially thought necessary is not needed for this tutorial at all
- **A planned test was dropped rather than faked.** P2.7 Step 5 was scoped as comparing gromos-rs's classical buffer energy against "the MM baseline the training pipeline used". No such baseline exists: no classical term enters BuRNN training anywhere, and `get_reference_energies()` is not merely "not finished" but **never called**. Building it would have manufactured a false-confidence oracle; it was replaced with the partition-consistency check above, which answers the same underlying question ("how would we detect if the two sides' logics differ?") at the level the contract actually lives
- **Nothing is wired yet.** `ZonePartition` is exported but consumed by nothing; `LjCrfInteraction` does not filter by zone; no binary iterates providers. A QM/MM force term can be *validated* today but a QM/MM simulation cannot be *run* — see PLAN.md P2.8, whose first item is the only blocker that changes this
- This is Dim 12.5 groundwork (the classical-side invariants) plus a first proof that the ML seam actually works end to end — not a production ML engine. Design reviewed from three independent lenses (GROMOS-fidelity/porting-discipline, Rust trait/extensibility, ML-integration prior-art) before implementation; corrections from that review are reflected above.
- **Environment finding worth keeping:** getting `tch`/libtorch to actually run in this sandbox took two real fixes, not zero. (1) The cached conda-forge MKL-linked libtorch failed even to `import torch` in Python with "cannot enable executable stack" — a kernel/sandbox restriction on that specific MKL build, unrelated to Rust; the official PyPI CPU wheel doesn't have this problem. (2) `tch` pins an exact libtorch version per release (`torch-sys`'s build script hard-checks it) — `tch = "0.24.0"` requires precisely **libtorch 2.11.0**; nearby versions (2.13 tried first) fail the check outright rather than risk an ABI mismatch. Both are now recorded in `nonbonded/schnet.rs`'s module docs with the exact working recipe, since this is exactly the kind of non-obvious setup friction FUTURE.md's P2 (model-export boundary) warned would exist.
- **Runtime choice for the eventual ML provider, corrected via research:** GROMOS's real SchNet integration ("BuRNN", Poliak et al. 2025, *J. Comput. Chem.*) embeds SchNetPack via `pybind11` — the Python/GIL tax this design avoids. Checked current in-process prior art: OpenMM-ML and GROMACS's NNPot interface both route through libtorch/TorchScript, not ONNX — no production tool examined has a working ONNX export path for SchNet/MACE-class models. `tch` (TorchScript) is therefore the prior-art-backed reference point for a future ML provider, not `ort`/ONNX. No runtime is committed in this pass — `PotentialProvider` is a trait precisely so each model family can pick what fits it when that provider is actually built.
- `crates/gromos-forces/src/qmmm.rs` (file-in/file-out QM engine scaffolding, forks `xtb`, writes XYZ files) is legacy and was never wired into any binary or test — it predates this design and is not the basis for the new provider seam. Left untouched; its fate (repurpose vs. delete) is not decided here.
- **Checked against GROMOS's real NN(QM)/MM tutorial, not just designed from docs.** Cloned `github.com/biomos/gromos_tutorial_livecoms` into `.local/gromos_tutorial_livecoms` (gitignored, same pattern as `.local/gromosXX`) — Tutorial 6 ("BuRNN") is a working NN(QM)/MM example with a real trained SchNetPack model. Confirmed its `.qmm` file's `QMUNIT` block (`QMULEN/QMUENE/QMUFOR/QMUCHR`) is exactly the per-provider unit-conversion approach this design chose, and that `QMZONE`'s `QMZ` column (atomic number) matches the real model's embedding convention (`Embedding(100, 256, padding_idx=0)`) — the model now indexes elements by atomic number to match. **Ran the real trained model end to end** (schnetpack v1 in a torch venv, with `np.int`/`np.float` shimmed back for modern numpy) — real forward+backward pass, output converted through the tutorial's own unit factors into GROMOS units. Then tried `torch.jit.script` on that real model: **it fails** (`schnetpack/nn/neighbors.py` uses a Python-style conditionally-typed return TorchScript's type system rejects) — a concrete, not hypothetical, confirmation of FUTURE.md P2 ("not every architecture exports cleanly")
- **SchNetPack v1 → 2.x, same session.** That scripting failure is a v1 problem, not an inherent SchNet one: verified `schnetpack.model.NeuralNetworkPotential` (real `SchNet` + an `atomistic.Forces` output module, SchNetPack **2.2.0**) scripts cleanly. `export_toy_schnet.py` and `SchNetInteraction` were both rewritten around the real library instead of the earlier hand-rolled stand-in — see Features/Testing above. `Forces` requires including it explicitly as an output module (a bare `Atomwise` alone fails TorchScript's type inference on an empty `required_derivatives` list)
- Explicitly deferred: wiring any MD binary's force-accumulation loop to iterate `Vec<Box<dyn PotentialProvider>>`; a *trained* ML provider (this pass's model is architecturally real but untrained); making `contribute` async/cancellable for external-process providers; a shared typed-units boundary (each provider currently owns its own unit conversion).

## [0.0.24] (2026-07-02)

### Features

- **pyo3-gromos:** `sim.run(steps, ene_freq=100)` — batch MD loop in Rust returning an `(n_frames, 12)` numpy energy array (`[time, kinetic, potential, total, volume, pressure, bond, angle, improper, dihedral, lj, coulomb]`); no `.tre` file round-trip (P3.3)
- **py-gromos:** `EnergyTimeseries` (`python/gromos/timeseries.py`) wraps the `run()` array: named-column access, `block_average()`, `to_dataframe()` (polars/pandas/dict), `plot()` (plotly/matplotlib); defaults configurable via `gromos.timeseries.config` (P3.3)
- **pyo3-gromos:** `InputParameters.nve/nvt/npt` take `constraints="none"|"hbonds"|"allbonds"` (default `"none"`) mapping to GROMOS `NTC`, plus a readable `.constraints` getter — factory-built params can now SHAKE (P3.5 M1)
- **pyo3-gromos:** `InputParameters.steepest_descent()` now actually minimizes when run through `Simulation` — previously silently fell through to leap-frog at `dt=0`. New `SteepestDescent` algorithm-sequence building block and `AlgorithmSequence.minimize()` preset; `from_parameters()` dispatches to it when `NTEM > 0` (P3.5 SD)
- **pyo3-gromos:** `sim.volume` / `sim.pressure` getters, mirroring `sim.temperature`. `pressure` is only physically meaningful under NPT — the virial term is only populated by `PressureCalculation`, which only NPT's sequence includes; under NVE/NVT it returns the kinetic-only term, not zero, and is documented as such

### Fixes

- **gromos-forces:** `calculate_bonded_forces_ntf` summed bond/angle/dihedral/improper into a single scalar with no per-term breakdown; every call site (`algorithms/forcefield.rs` — the main path every `Simulation.step()` uses, plus `replica.rs`, `gamd.rs`) dumped the combined total entirely into `bond_total`, leaving `angle_total`/`dihedral_total`/`improper_total` at zero for every simulation, not just Python. Added `bond_energy`/`angle_energy`/`dihedral_energy`/`improper_energy` fields to `ForceEnergy`, populated where each term is still separate, before combining. Also fixes the GaMD dihedral-boost term in `md.rs`, which read the same always-zero field
- **pyo3-gromos:** `temperature` getter used bare `n_atoms*3` instead of the constraint-aware degrees of freedom the thermostat actually couples to (`3*n_atoms - solvent_constraint_dof - ndfmin`) — the two could silently disagree. Extracted `compute_total_dof()` as the single source of truth for both builders and the getter (P3.5 M2)

### Testing

- **py-gromos:** `test_run_matches_step_loop`, `test_energy_timeseries` — `run()` matches an equivalent `step(1)` loop; `EnergyTimeseries` column access, `block_average`, `to_dataframe`/`plot` backends
- **py-gromos:** `test_factory_constraints_knob`, `test_constrained_system_stable_with_factory_params` — factory `constraints=` sets `NTC` correctly; `aladip_solvated` (flexible solute H-bonds) stays stable under `constraints="hbonds"` and diverges under `"none"` (documented contrast)
- **py-gromos:** `test_steepest_descent_via_simulation`, `test_steepest_descent_via_algorithm_sequence` — EM actually decreases potential energy and converges; the direct and composable EM paths agree
- **py-gromos:** `test_volume_and_pressure_getters` — `sim.volume`/`sim.pressure` match `run()`'s array columns; NVE/NVT volume is exactly fixed, NPT's responds to the barostat
- **gromos-io:** `test_factory_constraints_knob` — `ntc_from_constraints()` mapping and error case

### Documentation

- **py-gromos/notebooks:** replaced `01_understanding_pyo3_bindings.ipynb`, `02_molecular_systems_and_energy.ipynb`, `03_performance_deep_dive.ipynb` (referenced the nonexistent `gromos.State`) with `01_load_and_inspect.ipynb` and `02_short_md.ipynb` against real reference systems — topology/config inspection, RDF, manual `Topology.solvate()` + `System(topo, conf)` composition, native-parameter MD, energy-component breakdown, block-averaging, NVE/NVT/NPT ensemble comparison (temperature/volume/pressure), and energy minimization, all executed with real baked-in plotly/matplotlib output
- **py-gromos:** `pyproject.toml` `notebooks` dependency group (`jupyter`, `ipykernel`, `matplotlib`, `plotly`, `polars`); CI and Makefile use `uv sync --all-groups` instead of ephemeral `--with` packages
- **py-gromos/docs:** `api/reference.md`, `index.md`, `quick-start.md`, `learning-guide.md` updated for `constraints=`, `sim.run()`/`EnergyTimeseries`, `SteepestDescent`/EM, `sim.volume`/`sim.pressure`; removed the stale "planned, not yet implemented" P3.3 section
- **py-gromos:** `md_runners.py` marked deprecated (docstring notice, points at `Simulation`)
- **PLAN.md / FUTURE.md:** P3.1–3.5 marked done with verification notes; audited and parked a composition-pattern redesign (constraints-on-`System`, unified builders) as tech debt with no triggering need yet — recorded as a deliberate divergence bet in `FUTURE.md`, not scheduled

## [0.0.23] (2026-06-29)

### Features

- **pyo3-gromos:** `PySystem` — paired `Topology` + `Configuration` with atom-count validation at construction; `System.from_files(topo, cnf)` convenience loader; `write(path)` for `.cnf` output (P3.1)
- **pyo3-gromos:** `InputParameters` factory methods `nve(dt, steps)`, `nvt(dt, steps, temperature)`, `npt(dt, steps, temperature, pressure)`, `steepest_descent(steps)` — no `.imd` file required (P3.2)
- **pyo3-gromos:** `InputParameters.from_file(path)` staticmethod alias of the constructor
- **pyo3-gromos:** `Simulation(system, params)` two-argument constructor accepting `System` + `InputParameters`; existing three-argument forms unchanged (P3.2)
- **gromos-io:** `ImdParameters::nve / nvt / npt / steepest_descent` factory methods on the Rust struct

### Testing

- **py-gromos:** `test_system_constructor_matches_file_constructor` — `Simulation(System, params)` is bit-identical to `Simulation(Topology, Configuration, params)` on `water_216_nvt` (energy rel=1e-8)
- **py-gromos:** `test_system_factory_workflow` — full P3.2 workflow: `System.from_files` + `InputParameters.nvt` + `Simulation` + `step(10)` on `water_3_box`
- **py-gromos:** `test_factory_nvt_properties` — factory stores `dt`, `nstlim`, `temperature` correctly
- **gromos-io:** unit tests for all four factory methods (`test_factory_nve/nvt/npt/steepest_descent`)
- **py-gromos:** fixed 6 stale `test_advanced_features.py` test classes missing `@pytest.mark.skip`

### Build

- **Makefile (root):** added `.venv`, `requirements`, `build-python`, `build-release`, `test-python`, `docs`, `docs-serve` targets
- **py-gromos/Makefile:** added `docs`, `docs-serve` targets
- **`.gitignore`:** added `py-gromos/site/`

### Documentation

- **py-gromos/docs:** full rewrite of all seven documentation pages to reflect the working API; removed all phantom class references (`State`, `Box`, `LeapFrog`, GaMD/EDS/REMD runners); added accurate status tables, P3.3/FUTURE roadmap sections
- **py-gromos/python/gromos/__init__.py:** stripped to only working names; removed `system_builder` stubs, `md_runners` functions, and `analysis` wrappers from top-level namespace
- **py-gromos/python/gromos/gromos.pyi:** added `InputParameters` factory stubs, `System` class, `Simulation` two-arg `@overload`

## [0.0.22] (2026-06-27)

### Features

- **gromos-core:** `PairlistAlgorithm` enum (`Standard`, `CellList`) with `from_imd()` dispatch
  and `update<BC>()` delegation via match — zero heap allocation on the hot path (9a-0)
- **gromos-core:** `from_imd()` slots match gromosXX exactly: 0=standard (forced), 1=grid
  (ExtendedGrid fallback→Standard), 2=grid_cell (CellList); IMD parser now recognises
  `"grid_cell"` keyword; no auto-heuristic — every value is an explicit instruction
- **gromos-core:** 9 unit tests covering full dispatch matrix (algorithm × box_type × n_atoms × chargegroups)
- **gromos-integrators, gromos-md, pyo3-gromos:** `StandardPairlistAlgorithm` field swapped to
  `PairlistAlgorithm` everywhere; `md.rs` calls `from_imd(imd.algorithm, …)` (9a-0)

### Testing

- **gromos-md:** `test_pairlist_margin.rs` — empirical CellList vs Standard margin test on
  `water_216_box` (100 steps); observed margin = 0.000e0 (bit-identical) (9a-1)
- **gromos-md:** `water_1000_spc_gridcell` reference — 1000 equilibrated SPC molecules
  (3.1057 nm box, vol7 tutorial), gromosXX Grid_Cell_Pairlist (7×7×7 grid); directly
  validates gromos-rs CellList against gromosXX; completes the proof chain

  `superimpose()`, `rmsd()`, `kabsch_rotation()`, `weighted_cog()`; 7 unit tests

  E_bond, E_lj, E_crf, E_pot; optional PBC gathering

  reference, Shirts 2003); bootstrap error estimation
- **gromos-analysis:** `ext_ti_merge` — linear interpolation between λ windows;
  trapezoidal ΔG from merged curve
- **gromos-analysis:** `frameout` — full GROMOS feature parity: PBC gathering (@pbc),
  atom filtering (@include SOLUTE/SOLVENT/ALL), rotational fit (@ref @atomsfit),
  @spec ALL/EVERY/SPEC, @time range, cnf/pdb/trc output, @single; 8 integration tests
- **gromos-io:** `TrajectoryWriter::write_trc_frame()` — write POSITIONRED frames directly
  from positions (no Configuration needed); standard 3-column GROMOS format
- **gromos-io:** `write_pdb_positions()` in `pdb.rs` — write PDB from raw positions +
  optional topology for atom names; re-exported from lib.rs
- **gromos-io:** `TrajectoryReader` now handles both 3-column (standard GROMOS) and legacy
  7-column POSITIONRED formats; GENBOX made optional (vacuum trajectories)
- **gromos-core:** `selection.rs` — `m:` prefix: selects solute molecules by role
  (mirrors `s:` for solvent); improved error messages with full syntax cheatsheet and
  specific hints for common mistakes (`r:`, `mol:`, bare atom names as prefix)
- **gromos-analysis:** tests — 8 `frameout` integration tests + 7 trajectory round-trip
  unit tests in `gromos-io`

### Refactor

- **gromos-analysis:** `fit.rs` relocated from `gromos-core` → `gromos-analysis`;
  `gromos-forces` added as dependency of `gromos-analysis`
- All analysis binaries use only `gromos-io` for I/O — zero hand-rolled BufWriter/File
  in binary entry points
- PLAN.md restructured: Dim 10 section dissolved into Priority 2; priority order updated
  (CellList wiring → code quality → dihedral restraints → Dim 10 Phase 3)

## [0.0.20] (2026-06-26)

  Direct field access everywhere: `topo.moltypes[0].bonds`, no wrapper methods.
  `MoleculeType` carries atoms + all bonded terms; `Atom = MolTypeAtom` (type alias);
  `Solute` reduced to ZST shell; `Solvent` struct and `Vec<Solvent>` field removed.
  `rebuild_flat_arrays()`: iac/mass/charge derived from instance registry (Phase 2a).
  `all_bonds_global()` / `all_angles_global()` / etc.: instance-iterating force-loop
  iterators with local→global index translation — one loop handles flexible solute,
  flexible solvent (future), and any repeated molecule type (Phase 3).
  `Topology::new()` pre-initializes `moltypes[0]` (SOLUTE) + `instances[0]` so no
  guard methods are needed at write sites.
  Follows GROMACS `gmx_moltype_t` / `gmx_molblock_t` convention exactly.
  37/37 reference tests pass byte-identical.

  `1:res(nr:atom)`, `1:res(name:atom)`, `not(spec)`, `minus(spec)`, `;`-union, `all`/`no`;
  routes via `topology.molecules` (no `num_solute_atoms()` threshold, Dim 10 ready);

  prefer moltype path; `s:` in AtomSelection uses `role == Role::Solvent`; `promote()`;
  37/37 reference tests byte-identical

### Test infrastructure

- Shared topology/coord/ptp files moved to `tests/gromosXX_references/shared/`;
  all `input.toml` paths updated from `../../` to `../shared/`
- `.trg` free-energy trajectory tracked in `ch4_water_fep` (dH/dλ at 1e-6 rel tol)
- `run_references.py` removed (both copies); Rust runner is the only harness
- 37 tests pass (up from 36); 1 ignored

## [0.0.18] (2026-06-19)

### Features

- **gromos-core:** add `PerturbedAtom` and `PerturbedAtomPair` structs; extend
  `PerturbedSolute` with `atoms` + `atom_pairs` fields; add `is_perturbed: Vec<bool>`
  to `Topology` (P1.7 Step 1 scaffolding)
- **gromos-io:** replace ptp.rs stub with a full gromosXX-faithful `.pttopo` reader
  (`read_pttopo`); parses PERTATOMPARAM, PERTATOMPAIR, PERTBONDSTRETCH(H),
  PERTBONDANGLE(H), PERTIMPROPERDIH(H), PERTPROPERDIH(H); validated against
  `aladip.pttopo` (3 atoms, 1 pair, 2 bonds, 2 angles, 2 impropers, 2 dihedrals)
- **gromos-md:** wire `@pttopo` into md binary — when NTG≠0, read perturbation topology
  and populate `topo.perturbed_solute` + `topo.is_perturbed`
- **gromos-core:** fix `Energies::total()` to include `distanceres_total` (matches
  gromosXX: `total = potential_total + kinetic_total + special_total` where
  `special_total` includes distance restraints)
- **gromos-md:** add `nacl_1water_distres` reference test — instantaneous distance
  restraint (NTDIR=2) on Na-Cl pair; validates total energy accounting and step-0
  forces; 36 of 36 tests pass

### Reference test matrix

- 36 tests pass (up from 34); new: `nacl_1water_distres` (distance restraint)

## [0.0.17] (2026-06-17)

### Features

- **gromos-forces:** port gromosXX distance restraints (PLAN.md §1.6, first priority)
  - `DistanceRestraint` / `DistanceRestraints` — faithful translation of
    `distance_restraint_interaction.cc`: RAH dimensionality encoding
    (`dim_base ∈ {0,10,20,30,40,50,60}` × form `∈ {-1,0,+1}`), harmonic/linear
    switching (gromosXX `r_linear = DIR0 = 0.3 nm`), mode 1 / mode 2 (NTDIR=2 ×w0)
  - `PerturbedDistanceRestraint` / `PerturbedDistanceRestraints` — translation of
    `perturbed_distance_restraint_interaction.cc`: λ-interpolated r0/w0,
    hidden-restraint prefactor `2^(n+m)·λⁿ·(1-λ)ᵐ`
  - Reference test `test_distance_restraint_gromosxx_reference` validates both at
    gromosXX's own hard-coded values: DistanceRestraint = 257.189539 kJ/mol,
    PerturbedDistanceRestraint = 195.899012 kJ/mol (aladip.distrest, tol 1e-3)
- **gromos-core:** add `DistanceRestraintSpec` / `PerturbedDistanceRestraintSpec` to
  `topology.rs`; extend `Topology` with `distance_restraints` /
  `perturbed_distance_restraints` Vec fields
- **gromos-core:** add `distanceres_total: f64` to `Energy` struct
- **gromos-io:** new `distanceres.rs` parser for DISTANCERESSPEC / PERTDISRESSPEC
  blocks (virtual atom type 0 only; unsupported types logged + skipped)
- **gromos-io:** parse DISTANCERES block (`NTDIR NTDIRA CDIR DIR0 TAUDIR FORCESCALE
  VDIR NTWDIR`) and PERTURBATION block (`NTG NRDGL RLAM DLAMT ALPHLJ ALPHC NLAM
  NSCALE`) in `imd.rs`; add `ImdParameters::lambda_and_derivative()` helper
- **gromos-integrators:** wire `DistanceRestraints` / `PerturbedDistanceRestraints`
  into `Forcefield` (step 4c after position restraints); result accumulated into
  `conf.current_mut().energies.distanceres_total`

### Reference test matrix

- 13 restraint tests pass (13 restraint-specific, up from 0 gromosXX-faithful)
- All other workspace tests unchanged

## [0.0.16] (2026-06-14)

### Features

- **gromos-core:** add `CellListPairlistAlgorithm` (FUTURE.md Dim 9a) — a charge-group-aware
  linked-cell pairlist, drop-in via the existing `update<BC>()` interface
  - Bins each chargegroup's reference position (solute CG → COG, solvent CG → first-atom
    position, matching `StandardPairlistAlgorithm`'s own distance conventions) into a grid that
    exactly tiles the box, with cells ≥ `long_range_cutoff + skin` and a periodic-wrapped,
    deduplicated 27-cell neighbor search (correct even when `grid_dim` is 1 or 2 along an axis)
  - O(N) for `BoxType::Rectangular`; vacuum/triclinic/truncated-octahedron boxes fall back to
    `StandardPairlistAlgorithm`'s O(N²) path (correct, not yet accelerated)
  - Pairs are classified by `min/max(cg_a, cg_b)` against `num_solute_chargegroups` — both
    chargegroups' roles — avoiding the Martina solute/solvent misclassification bug
    (`extended_grid_pairlist_algorithm.cc:1309`)
  - Replaces the old, unexported, non-chargegroup-aware `GridCellPairlistAlgorithm` stub
- **gromos-core:** add set-equality tests (`test_cell_list_matches_standard_*`) validating that
  `CellListPairlistAlgorithm` produces identical `solute_short/long`/`solvent_short/long` pair
  sets to `StandardPairlistAlgorithm`, covering periodic wrap, the single-cell fallback, and
  mixed solute+solvent with exclusions

### Reference test matrix

- 35 of 35 tests pass (unchanged — `StandardPairlistAlgorithm` remains the only algorithm wired
  into the `md`/`pyo3-gromos` binaries)

## [0.0.15] (2026-06-14)

### Features

- **gromos-core:** port `truncoct_triclinic_rotmat` / `truncoct_triclinic_box` / `truncoct_triclinic`
  (gromosXX `math/transformation.cc`) for NTB=-1 truncated-octahedron boxes
  - `forward`/`!forward` APIs convert the legacy cube-edge BOX block to/from the lower-triangular
    triclinic box vectors and rotate positions/velocities between the cube and triclinic frames
  - Add `Box::truncated_octahedral()`
- **gromos-core:** replace `Triclinic::nearest_image`'s textbook `frac - frac.round()` reduction
  with gromosXX's iterative while-loop z→y→x reduction (`boundary_implementation.cc:285-318`) —
  not equivalent for strongly triclinic cells (FUTURE.md Dim 11, finding #1)
- **gromos-integrators:** `forcefield.rs` periodicity refresh now also matches
  `BoxType::TruncatedOctahedral`
- **gromos-md:** wire NTB=-1 in the `md` binary — convert the BOX block, rotate positions/velocities
  on read, build `Periodicity::Triclinic` from the resulting box, and rotate
  `FREEFORCERED`/`CONSFORCERED` back to the cube frame on output
  (`out_configuration.cc::_print_forcered`)
- **gromos-md:** add `aladip_trunc_oct` gromosXX reference test (truncated octahedron, NTB=-1)

### Bug fixes

- **gromos-core:** fix `truncoct_triclinic_rotmat`'s forward/backward rotation — gromosXX's
  `product(rot, v)` (`gmath.h`) computes `rot^T * v`, not `rot * v`, because `GenericMatrix`'s
  3-`Vec` constructor stores its arguments as rows while `product()` contracts over the matrix's
  first index. The initial port had the two branches exactly swapped. Added a regression test
  pinned to a gromosXX debug-build reference value for `aladip.conf` atom 21.

### Reference test matrix

- 35 of 35 tests pass (up from 34); new: `aladip_trunc_oct` (truncated octahedron / NTB=-1)

## [0.0.14] (2026-06-12)

### Features

- **gromos-integrators:** implement Nosé-Hoover thermostat — single NHC and NHC chain
  - `NoseHooverThermostat` struct with `new_single_bath` (nhc=1) and `new_chain_bath` (nhc≥2)
  - Single NHC: `ζ[0] += dt/τ² · (T_free/T₀ - 1)`, `scale = 1 - ζ[0]·dt`
  - Chain NHC: sequential tail-to-head ζ update (gromosXX `calc_chain_scaling`)
  - Wired in `md.rs` via `imd.temp_bath[0].algorithm` dispatch (0=Berendsen, 1=NHC, N=chain)
- **gromos-io:** fix MULTIBATH algorithm code mapping to match gromosXX exactly
  (0=weak-coupling, 1=nose-hoover, N≥2=nose-hoover-chains); add `nhc_chain` field
- **gromos-md:** add `water_216_nvt_nosehoover` and `water_216_nvt_nhc_chain` reference tests

### Reference test matrix

- 34 of 34 tests pass (up from 32); new: NHC single, NHC chain

## [0.0.13] (2026-06-12)

### Features

- **gromos-integrators:** wire SETTLE, LINCS, and COM rotation removal into the MD algorithm
  sequence; all three are now reference-tested and passing
  - `SettleAlgorithm` / `LincsAlgorithm` wired for solvent (NTCS=settle/lincs) and solute
    (NTCP=lincs); reference tests: `nacl_1water_settle`, `nacl_1water_lincs`, `aladip_vacuum_lincs`
  - COM rotation removal (`RemoveCOMMotion`) fully wired; reference test: `water_216_box_com_rot`

### Bug fixes

- **gromos-integrators:** fix COM rotation removal for PBC systems
  - Use minimum-image (put_into_box) wrapped positions when computing angular momentum and
    inertia tensor, mirroring gromosXX's `gather_chargegroups` init convention
    (`periodicity.cc:175`); without this the position-COM and angular momentum diverged
  - Suppress *periodic* COM rotation removal when the box is periodic, matching gromosXX
    `configuration.cc:555-560` (`param.centreofmass.remove_rot = false` for non-vacuum PBC)
  - Remove leftover debug `eprintln!` that printed all 648 atom positions at step 0
- **gromos-io:** fix `imd.rs` parsing for NTCP/NTCS lincs/settle keywords and LINCS order params

### Reference test matrix

- 32 of 32 tests pass (up from 28); new: SETTLE, LINCS (solvent+solute), COM rotation removal

## [0.0.12] (2026-06-07)

### Features

- **gromos-core:** add `random` module — GSL-compatible `mt19937` RNG (`GslMt19937`) and
  `gsl_ran_gaussian` (Marsaglia polar method), plus `generate_velocities` for NTIVEL=1
  Maxwell-Boltzmann initial velocity generation, matching gromosXX `util::generate_velocities` /
  `math::RandomGeneratorGSL` bit-for-bit
- **gromos-md:** wire NTIVEL=1 into `md` binary's velocity setup (reads NTIVEL/IG/TEMPI from
  INITIALISE block); add `water_single_genvel` reference test verifying generated velocities
  reproduce gromosXX trajectories exactly

## [0.0.11] (2026-06-07)

### Features

- **gromos-integrators:** add steepest descent energy minimization algorithm

- **gromos-io:** add IFP, MTB, posres, mk_script, jobs, and script_template parsers (~2,600 lines)
- **gromos-tools:** add `prep_posres` utility; rewrite `ion`, `sim_box`, `pdb2g96`, `com_top`, `make_top`, and `mk_script` against the new parsers
- **gromos-tools:** implement `build_box` (replaces hardcoded placeholder) — generates a condensed-phase system on a regular grid sized to a target density, matching gromosXX `build_box.cc`
- **core/forces:** update configuration and position restraints handling

### Performance

- **forces/shake:** optimize nonbonded hot path and SHAKE with cache-friendly data structures
  - Replace `HashSet` exclusions with sorted `Vec` + binary search in topology
  - Flatten LJ parameter matrix into a contiguous `LJParamMatrix` (removes double indirection)
  - Add `ShakeBuffers` for precomputed constraint lists and reusable skip arrays
  - Add CG-grouped nonbonded kernel (`CGPairGroup`): compute PBC nearest-image once per charge-group pair
  - Add parallel (`_parallel`) and no-virial (`_novirial`) innerloop variants and `ForceStorage::merge` for thread-local reduction
  - Add Criterion benchmark suite (`gromos-md/benches/md_bench.rs`)
  - Fix duplicate energy/force accumulation in `calculate_dihedral_new_forces`

### Refactor

- **workspace:** remove the `gromos-cli` crate (superseded by the per-crate binary layout from the 0.0.10 restructure)
- **workspace:** condense and reorganize `PLAN.md` into a priority-ordered roadmap (MD engine physics → analysis foundations → py-gromos/education → code quality)

### Bug Fixes

- **ci:** fix Rust workflow steps using an incorrect `working-directory: gromos-rs` (the workspace lives at the repo root); fix coverage lcov output path and the crates.io publish job directory (`crates/gromos`)

### Chores

- **workspace:** clean up workspace `Cargo.toml`, `Makefile`, and update `py-gromos` reference test paths

## [0.0.10] (2026-05-17)

  - `gromos-tools`: 30 system construction binaries organized in subdirectories (topology/, box/, conversion/, utilities/)
  - `gromos-analysis`: 66 analysis binaries organized in subdirectories (structural/, energy/, distribution/, dynamics/, free_energy/, trajectory/, noe/, clustering/, xray/, special/) + existing library code
  - `gromos-cli`: slimmed to thin unified `gromos` multicall binary (clap only)
  - `gromos` facade: removed `gromos-analysis` re-export to avoid circular dependency; analysis bins use `gromos_core`/`gromos_io` directly
  - All 21 reference tests pass, workspace compiles clean

## [0.0.9](https://github.com/yerkoescalona/gromos-rs/compare/v0.0.8...v0.0.9) (2026-03-29)

### Bug Fixes

- **forces:** fix CRF energy mismatch (~3.82 kJ/mol) for systems with solvent near cutoff boundary
  - Expand solvent long-range pairlist to all atom pairs (was: first-atom only with shared PBC shift)
  - Remove HEAVISIDE truncation from `lj_crf_innerloop` to match gromosXX `#undef XXHEAVISIDE` default
  - Long-range solvent now processed with `lj_crf_innerloop` (per-atom nearest_image) instead of `solvent_innerloop`

### Features

  - water_10_box: 2 ions + 10 SPC waters (32 atoms), positions away from cutoff boundaries
  - nacl_water_box_shifted: nacl_water_box with perturbed positions near cutoff
- **tests:** promote nacl_water_box, nacl_water_box_shifted, nacl_3water_cutoff from ignored to active

  - Add `solvent_innerloop` with shared PBC shift from O-O nearest_image
  - Split `rf_excluded_interactions` into solute/solvent paths:
    - Solute: self-term + excluded pair forces + full RF energy
    - Solvent: no self-term, no forces, only distance-dependent energy
  - Add `cutoff_sq` to CRFParameters

### Refactor

- **pairlist:** separate solute/solvent CG pairs with correct distance metrics
  - Solute CGs: center-of-geometry distance, exclusion checks

## [0.0.7](https://github.com/yerkoescalona/gromos-rs/compare/v0.0.6...v0.0.7) (2026-03-02)

### Refactor

- **io:** gromosXX-compatible topology init order with solvate() ([60207d9](https://github.com/yerkoescalona/gromos-rs/commit/60207d9584e67c0ae622ed6267f19fd38965467e))
  - Follow gromosXX initialization: read_parameter → read_topology → solvate → read_configuration
  - Add Topology::solvate(nsm) method matching gromosXX topo.solvate(0, nsm)
  - Add SolventAtomTemplate/SolventConstraintTemplate types on Topology
  - build_topology() now stores solvent template without expanding
