"""QM-vs-ML comparison, from Python — the direct follow-up to `test_ml_potential.py`.

`crates/gromos-md/tests/qm_vs_ml_comparison.rs` already does this in Rust (real `XtbInteraction`
vs a trained `SchNetInteraction`, RMSE check). Until now there was no way to get a real QM
reference value from Python at all — `SchNetPotential` could be attached to a `Simulation`, but
nothing exposed `XtbInteraction`. `XtbPotential` (this session's follow-up to P3.7) closes that.

Skips gracefully if `xtb` isn't on `PATH`. Uses the real trained model from
`scripts/train_qmmm_schnet.py` (`/tmp/trained_water_schnet.pt`) if present — the same file
`qm_vs_ml_comparison.rs` uses — for a real, meaningful RMSE check; falls back to a fresh
untrained toy model (`export_toy_schnet.py`) otherwise, with a much weaker claim (finite,
right-shaped output — not a physics check), same honesty tier as the rest of this repo's `ml`
tests.
