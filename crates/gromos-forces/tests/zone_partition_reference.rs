//! **PLAN.md P2.7 Step 5 (revised)** — the double-counting contract, checked on the real system.
//!
//! # Why this replaces the originally-planned oracle
//!
//! Step 5 was originally scoped as: recompute the classical buffer energy with gromos-rs and
//! compare against "the MM baseline the BuRNN training pipeline used". **That premise is false**,
//! and the tutorial's own source disproves it:
//!
//! - `train_dataset_tutorial/mopac.py::get_burnn_energy()` subtracts two **MOPAC** (QM) energies —
//!   `compl_energy_kj − buffer_energy_kj`. No classical energy appears (assumption **A2**).
//! - Grepping the whole training pipeline for `lj|coulomb|classical|forcefield` returns nothing:
//!   no MM term enters training at any point.
//! - `get_reference_energies()` — the function that would have produced the vacuum references —
//!   is marked `# not finished`, is **never called**, and never returns a value; the references
//!   are hand-supplied through the constructor instead.
//!
//! So there is no MM baseline to reproduce, and inventing one would have manufactured a
//! false-confidence test. PLAN.md P2.7 Step 5 explicitly said to drop it in this case.
//!
//! # What is actually checkable, and is checked here
//!
//! The real question Step 5 was reaching for — *"how do we detect if the two sides' logics
//! differ?"* — has a genuine answer at the level the contract lives: **the ownership table must
//! partition the interactions**. If the three owners overlap, terms get double-counted; if they
//! leave a gap, physics silently vanishes. Both are checkable on real data without any QM
//! reference, and both are exactly the failure modes assumption **A5** says nothing detects at
//! runtime.
//!
//! Fixture is the real BuRNN tutorial system with its real zone parameters (gitignored `.local/`
//! clone; skips gracefully when absent).
