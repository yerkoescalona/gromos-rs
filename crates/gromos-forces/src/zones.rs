//! Zone partitioning and **interaction ownership** — who computes which atom pair.
//!
//! **PLAN.md P2.7 Step 4.** In a partitioned QM/MM or BuRNN system, more than one provider can
//! plausibly claim the same atom pair, and nothing detects that at runtime: two independently
//! written providers share no contract (assumption **A5**). Double-counting is therefore
//! prevented by an *explicit, static* ownership table applied by the orchestrator — not by
//! hidden logic inside either provider, and not by hoping their conventions happen to agree.
//!
//! # Why this exact table (derived, not assumed)
//!
//! The BuRNN training target is read directly from the tutorial's own data-generation code,
//! `train_dataset_tutorial/mopac.py::get_burnn_energy()`:
//!
//! ```text
//! E_burnn = [E_QM(inner+buffer) − N_h2o·E_h2o_vac − E_solute_vac]
//!         − [E_QM(buffer)       − N_h2o·E_h2o_vac]
//! ```
//!
//! Both terms come from MOPAC — this is **QM minus QM**, not QM minus MM (assumption **A2**;
//! the vacuum terms are per-species self-energy normalisation). With the same waters in both
//! calls this reduces to `E_QM(inner+buffer) − E_QM(buffer) − E_solute_vac`, so the network
//! carries exactly: the inner region's internal energy, the full inner↔buffer interaction, and
//! the buffer's polarisation response — and explicitly **not** the buffer's own internal energy,
//! which the subtraction removes. `get_burnn_forces()` agrees per-atom: inner atoms take the
//! complex force unchanged, buffer atoms take `f_complex − f_buffer`.
//!
//! Everything the network does not carry must therefore still be computed classically, which
//! fixes the ownership of all six pair classes ([`PairOwner`]).
//!
//! # Van der Waals across the QM boundary (PLAN.md P2.8-4, resolved)
//!
//! Originally left undecided here — the tutorial's `md.imd` `QMMM` block lists seven field names
//! against six values, so `QMLJ`'s position was ambiguous from the tutorial alone. Resolved by
//! cloning `gromosXX` (`.local/gromosXX/md++/src`, gitignored) and reading the real source:
//! `io/parameter/in_parameter.cc::read_QMMM` (field order `NTQMMM NTQMSW RCUTQM NTWQMMM QMLJ
//! QMCON MMSCALE`) and `interaction/qmmm/qmmm_interaction.cc::modify_exclusions`, whose own
//! comment states the rule plainly:
//!
//! ```text
//!      QM  Buf  MM
//! QM    R    R  R/K
//! Buf   R    K   K
//! MM    R    K   K
//! R/K - keep in mechanical embedding, remove otherwise
//! Copy QM-QM only if requested to do QM-QM LJ
//! Copy QM-MM only if electrostatic or polarizable embedding
//! ```
//!
//! `QMLJ` (`qm_lj` on [`ZonePartition`]) gates the `copy` flag **only** for QM-QM (inner-inner)
//! and QM-buffer (inner-buffer) pairs (`case QM-QM`/the buffer branch of `case QM-MM` in
//! `modify_exclusions`) — i.e. it decides whether *provider-owned* pairs also get a classical LJ
//! supplement. It does **not** gate inner-outer pairs: those go through the unconditional
//! `else if (qmmm > mechanical) { copy = erase = true; }` branch, so **inner-outer LJ is always
//! classical**, regardless of `QMLJ` or the embedding scheme — only inner-outer *electrostatics*
//! is replaced (by [`Embedding::Electrostatic`]). `t_06` sets `QMLJ=0`, matching this crate's
//! previous (undocumented) assumption for inner-inner/inner-buffer, but that assumption was never
//! correct for inner-outer — see [`ZonePartition::lj_owner`], which is now the gromosXX-faithful
//! answer instead of a guess.
//!
//! # What this module still deliberately does not decide
//!
//! - **Excluded/1-4 pairs**, which follow the usual GROMOS rules independently of zoning.
