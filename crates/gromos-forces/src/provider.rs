//! `PotentialProvider` — the additive-provider shape for force/energy computation.
//!
//! Classical LJ+CRF, bonded terms, and (eventually) QM/MM and ML potentials all implement
//! this one trait. If classical terms are *already* providers, QM/MM and ML potentials are
//! just more providers later — additive, touching no existing physics (`architecture.md`
//! "the provider pattern"; `FUTURE.md` Dim 12.5).
//!
//! This module intentionally does **not** hand a provider `&mut Configuration`: that would
//! give any provider — including a future external QM/ML one — unchecked mutable access to
//! every atom's force/position/velocity, defeating the "contributes to an arbitrary but
//! *scoped* atom subset" invariant (FUTURE.md P5). Instead a provider reads state and
//! returns a scattered [`Contribution`]; the caller (which owns `Configuration`/`Energy`)
//! accumulates it and can validate which indices were touched before doing so.
